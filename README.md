This spigotaddon/plugin helps developers to tell if a client has already received an packet at a given point in time. For example this can help in detecting cheaters.
If you know how to avoid using concurrent things like CopyOnWriteArrayList, please create a pull request and fix. If errors occur, please create an issue :)
